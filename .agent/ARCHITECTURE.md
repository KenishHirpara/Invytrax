## Swarm / Supervisor Architecture

The Swarm system decomposes complex multi-domain goals into independent sub-tasks dispatched to specialist Workers.

```
/swarm [complex multi-domain goal]
        │
        ▽
  supervisor-agent (triage)
  └─ reads: swarm-worker-registry.md
  └─ emits: WorkerRequest JSON per sub-task
        │
        ├───── WorkerRequest ───→ Worker A (e.g. backend-specialist)
        ├───── WorkerRequest ───→ Worker B (e.g. database-architect)
        └───── WorkerRequest ───→ Worker C (e.g. documentation-writer)
                                    │
                          WorkerResult (success/failure/escalate)
                                    │
                         supervisor-agent (synthesize)
                                    │
                         ━━━ Swarm Complete ━━━
                         Human Gate → Y / N / R
```

**Key files:**

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `agents/supervisor-agent.md` | Triage, dispatch, retry, synthesis logic |
| `agents/swarm-worker-contracts.md` | WorkerRequest + WorkerResult JSON schemas |
| `agents/swarm-worker-registry.md` | Maps task types and keywords to specialist agents |
| `workflows/swarm.md` | `/swarm` slash command procedure |
| `scripts/swarm_dispatcher.py` | Validates WorkerRequest/WorkerResult JSON (use `--mode swarm`) |

**Constraints:**
- Maximum 5 Workers per swarm invocation
- Workers are independent — no Worker depends on another's pending result
- Failed workers are retried up to 3 times with targeted feedback
- Workers that fail after 3 retries are escalated, not silently dropped
- Human Gate is never skipped

## How the Tribunal Works

```
User prompt
    │
    ▼
GEMINI.md → Classify request → Select active reviewers
    │
    ▼
MAKER generates code (context-bound, no hallucinations)
    │
    ▼
ALL SELECTED REVIEWERS run in parallel
    │
    ├── Logic      → hallucinated methods?
    ├── Security   → OWASP violations?
    ├── Deps       → fake npm packages?
    ├── Types      → any/unsafe casts?
    ├── SQL        → injection / N+1?
    ├── Frontend   → hooks violations?
    ├── Perf       → O(n²) / blocking I/O?
    └── Tests      → tautology / no edges?
    │
    ▼
VERDICT: All approved → HUMAN GATE (you approve or reject the diff)
         Any failed   → Feedback returned to Maker for revision (max 3 attempts)
         3 failures   → HALT and escalate to human
```

## Auto Domain Routing (GEMINI.md)

| Keywords in prompt | Extra reviewers added |
|---|---|
| api, route, endpoint, server | + Dependency + TypeSafety |
| sql, query, database, orm | + SQL |
| component, hook, react, next | + Frontend + TypeSafety |
| test, spec, coverage, jest | + TestCoverage |
| optimize, slow, memory, cpu | + Performance |

| `strengthen_skills.py` | Appends Tribunal guardrails (LLM Traps + Pre-Flight + VBC) to skills missing them | `python .agent/scripts/strengthen_skills.py . --dry-run` |
| `swarm_dispatcher.py` | Validate Orchestrator micro-worker JSON payloads | `python .agent/scripts/swarm_dispatcher.py --file payload.json` |
| `skill_integrator.py` | Map active skills to executable scripts | `python .agent/scripts/skill_integrator.py` |
| `test_swarm_dispatcher.py` | Unit tests for swarm_dispatcher | `python .agent/scripts/test_swarm_dispatcher.py` |

## Error Recovery

```
Attempt 1  → Run with original parameters
Attempt 2  → Run with feedback from failure
Attempt 3  → Run with maximum constraints
Attempt 4  → HALT — escalate to human with full failure history
```

Script failures follow cascade rules:
- Security failure → **HALT** all steps
- Lint failure → continue, flag as deploy-blocker
- Test failure → continue analysis, mark incomplete
- Non-critical failure → log and continue
